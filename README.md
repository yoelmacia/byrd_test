# byrd-test

## To install the application once downloaded

```

## To run the reaction application once everything is installed

```
npm run serve
```

## To run the test

```
npm run test:unit
```

### General description

The application is made with Vue-CLI, so it will run at localhost:8080.

1. Implement the test with VueJS because I know how the framework works and I think it's super simple.

2. Use component in Vue called "Datepicker" for the dates.

3. Use "moment" for the format of those dates.

4. Use "axios" to make request to the API.

5. Use plain CSS to style the components.

6. The application has two components Costumers and Orders.

7. Add unit test with Jest for every component.

### Version 2.0

Implement Vuex to save the state of the application then the user could refresh the browser without lose the changes.

I hope you enjoy it! :D
