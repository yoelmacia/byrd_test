# byrd-test

This is a test code to create a invoice app for byrd

## To install the application once downloaded

```
npm install
```

### To run the reaction application once everything is installed

```
npm run serve
```

#### To run the test

```
npm run test:unit
```

#### General description

The application is made with Vue-CLI, so it will run at localhost:8080.

I decided to implement the test with VueJS because I know how the framework works and I think it's super simple.

I used a component, already created in Vue called "Datepicker" for the dates.

I used "moment" for the format of those dates.

I used "axios" to make request to the API.

I used plain CSS to style the components.

The application has two components Costumers and Orders.

Add unit test with Jest for every component.

#### Version 2.0

Implement Vuex to save the state of the application then the user could refresh the browser without lose the changes.

I hope you enjoy it! :D
